# PCOS Diagnosis Prediction Model

## Introduction
Welcome to the PCOS Diagnosis Prediction Model repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a woman has Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) based on various health metrics.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is synthetic and simulates data for women diagnosed with PCOS. It has been generated in accordance with the Rotterdam Criteria, established in 2003 by an international consensus of experts. According to these criteria, a woman must meet at least two of the following three conditions to be diagnosed with PCOS:
1. Irregular or absent menstrual periods
2. Elevated levels of androgens (male hormones)
3. Polycystic ovaries visible via ultrasound


### Important Notes
Although this dataset is synthetic, it may contain irregularities that do not accurately reflect real-world data. Therefore, any analysis or predictions made using this model should be accompanied by consultation with a medical specialist, especially if intended for commercial use.
The dataset includes categorical numeric columns for "Menstrual Irregularity" and "PCOS Diagnosis," which are encoded in binary format. Here, [0] indicates "no," and [1] means "yes."

### Objectives
- Develop a reliable model to predict PCOS diagnosis.
- Analyze the impact of various features on the likelihood of PCOS.
- Ensure that the model's predictions are clinically relevant and validated against expert opinions.

I hope this project contributes to a better understanding of PCOS and aids in early diagnosis and treatment. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and provide feedback!
